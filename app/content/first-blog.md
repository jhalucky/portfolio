# How I Started Coding: My Journey Into the World of Programming

Every coder has a story — a starting point, a spark that ignites curiosity, and a journey filled with late nights, bug fixes, and little victories that shape them into who they are today. This is mine. It’s a journey that began somewhat unexpectedly, and it has taken me across different domains of technology, helping me discover not just skills but also a passion that keeps me moving forward every day.

## The Beginning: Coding Looked Fancy But Felt Distant

I first stumbled into coding in **2021**, when I was in **11th grade**. Back then, computer science was just an additional subject I chose because it sounded fancy. Honestly, I didn’t even know what coding really meant. To me, it was something people in Silicon Valley did, sitting behind multiple monitors with green text flying across the screen like in movies.  

Unfortunately, life didn’t make it easier either. **Schools were shut down because of COVID-19**, and I didn’t even have proper access to a computer at home. Coding was not only distant, but it felt nearly impossible to touch. I saw computer science as a subject I had to pass rather than a world I could immerse myself in. My interest was minimal, almost non-existent at that time.

## The Spark in 12th Grade: Falling in Love with Python

Things changed when I entered **12th standard**. The curriculum required us to study **Python programming**. At first, I thought it would just be another boring subject, but slowly, things took a turn.  

I still remember the day we were asked to print simple patterns using Python. The thrill of writing a few lines of code and watching them come alive on the screen felt magical. Arithmetic operations, loops, conditions — every small program gave me a sense of power. It was like discovering a secret language that machines understood, and I was learning how to speak it.  

The **computer lab** became my favorite place in school. While most of my friends saw coding as a burden, I started enjoying every second of it. That was the first time I felt a genuine connection to programming.

## The Curiosity Expands: Exploring Languages Beyond Python

Once the curiosity kicked in, I couldn’t stop myself from exploring further. I started exploring more YouTube and Google, how this works? Soon, I discovered, there is not only pyhton in the game there are more programming languages. I explored about Java, C++ and JavaScript. I was amazed at how these languages were used to build different parts of the digital world: some for system-level programming, some for building applications, and some for creating the websites we use daily.  

This period was less about mastery and more about exploration. I wanted to taste everything, and each discovery deepened my fascination with coding.

## College Life: Web Development, Machine Learning, and Distractions

Then came college — a new chapter and a bigger world to explore. In my **first semester**, I was introduced to **web development**. I instantly loved it. The idea that I could create something visual and interactive, something people could *see and use* on their devices, was thrilling. I dived deep into HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, building small websites that made me feel like a digital architect.  

But in my **second semester**, my focus shifted. That was when I stumbled upon **machine learning (ML)**. The thought that code could not only follow instructions but also *learn and adapt* fascinated me. It was completely different from web development — more mathematical, more challenging, but also more futuristic. I started experimenting with Python libraries like NumPy, Pandas, and Scikit-learn.  

At times, I felt distracted — torn between the creative side of web development and the analytical side of machine learning. But in hindsight, that distraction wasn’t a weakness; it was part of my exploration, part of figuring out where I truly belonged in this vast world of technology.

## Lessons Along the Way

My journey so far has taught me a lot more than just syntax or frameworks. Coding, in its true essence, is about **problem-solving**. Every bug is a puzzle, every error message a clue, and every solution a triumph.  

Here are a few key lessons I’ve learned:  

1. **Patience is everything.** Debugging is frustrating, but persistence always pays off.  
2. **Curiosity drives growth.** The more you ask “why” and “how,” the deeper your understanding becomes.  
3. **Learning never stops.** Technology evolves at lightning speed, and being a coder means being a lifelong learner.  
4. **Passion makes it sustainable.** Without genuine interest, coding can feel like a chore. With passion, it becomes a playground.

## Where I Am Today

Fast forward to today, my coding journey is still ongoing. I’m not the same 11th grader who saw coding as just a fancy subject. Now, I see it as an art form, a craft that I want to master.  

I continue to balance my interests in **web development** and **machine learning**, while also exploring **AI, generative models, and open-source contributions**. Each new project I build, whether big or small, adds another piece to the puzzle of my journey.  

What excites me the most is not just the technical growth but also the creative possibilities. Coding has given me the freedom to **imagine and build**, to turn ideas into reality, and to dream bigger than I ever thought possible back in 2021.

## Closing Thoughts

When I look back at how it all started — with hesitation, lack of resources, and almost zero interest — I realize how far I’ve come. What began as a “fancy” subject has now become a **core part of my identity**.  

And the best part? I know this journey has no final destination. Coding isn’t something you finish; it’s something you live. Every project is a new beginning, every bug an opportunity to grow, and every idea a chance to innovate.  

So, here I am, still coding, still learning, and still falling in love with it — one line of code at a time.

*This is my story of how I started coding. If you’re just beginning your journey, remember — it doesn’t matter how late you start or how many obstacles you face. What matters is that spark of curiosity and the persistence to keep going.*
